# Automated Debugging
_______
Debugging is the process of identifying and removing errors from a given project. Coupled with logging, it becomes a powerful functionality that offers you information about your project and step-by-step highlighting, so that you can be sure it is error-free.

This repository contains exercises from CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security to implement a debugger from scratch using Python.
